                                  SPRING BOOT
                     ========================================

1.alternate use of @Postconstruct is initializingBean interface, this interface give method afterpropertiesSet() this 
method is execute just after constructor created .

2. Alternate use of @PreDestroy is DisposableBean interface , this interface give Destroy() , this method is execute 
   before object destroyed.
   
 3> What is SpringBoot
 ==========================================================================
  -> SpringBoot is a java framework that makes it easier to create and run java application.
  -> It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code 
     for their application.
  -> SpringBoot, is a module of spring framework, facilitates Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities.
  -> SpringBoot solve many developers problem :
       a. Configuration
       b. Dependency management
       c. Embedded Server
       
 4> Why SpringBoot over Spring ?
 ===========================================================================
  -> It's easy to use - Remove boilerplate code.
  -> Production Ready application - Metrix, Health Check, production ready application.
  -> Rapid development - auto-configuration enable developers to quick develop apps.
  -> provide dependency management.
  -> Auto-configuration.
  -> Embedded server.
  
 5> Working of SpringBoot
 ============================================================================
  -> SpringBoot starts by scanning the starter dependencies in pom.xml .
     Then download and auto-configure the module as you include in pom.xml .
  -> For example we have to create web application then we have to put spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pom.xml .
     when we start the project spring boot downloads all the dependency required for web and configure the thing 
     like spring mvc.
     
 6> How Spring Boot starts ?
 ===========================================================================
   -> Starts by calling main() method of you main class.
   -> The run() method of SpringApplication is called. This method starts the spring application by 
      creating an application context and initializing it.
   -> Once the application context is initialized, the run() method starts the applications 
      embedded web server.
