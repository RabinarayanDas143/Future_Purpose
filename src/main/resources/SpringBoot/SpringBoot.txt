                                  SPRING BOOT
                     ========================================

1.alternate use of @Postconstruct is initializingBean interface, this interface give method afterpropertiesSet() this 
method is execute just after constructor created .

2. Alternate use of @PreDestroy is DisposableBean interface , this interface give Destroy() , this method is execute 
   before object destroyed.
   
 3> What is SpringBoot
 ==========================================================================
  -> SpringBoot is a java framework that makes it easier to create and run java application.
  -> It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code 
     for their application.
  -> SpringBoot, is a module of spring framework, facilitates Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities.
  -> SpringBoot solve many developers problem :
       a. Configuration
       b. Dependency management
       c. Embedded Server
       
 4> Why SpringBoot over Spring ?
 ===========================================================================
  -> It's easy to use - Remove boilerplate code.
  -> Production Ready application - Metrix, Health Check, production ready application.
  -> Rapid development - auto-configuration enable developers to quick develop apps.
  -> provide dependency management.
  -> Auto-configuration.
  -> Embedded server.
  
 5> Working of SpringBoot
 ============================================================================
  -> SpringBoot starts by scanning the starter dependencies in pom.xml .
     Then download and auto-configure the module as you include in pom.xml .
  -> For example we have to create web application then we have to put spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pom.xml .
     when we start the project spring boot downloads all the dependency required for web and configure the thing 
     like spring mvc.
     
 6> How Spring Boot starts ?
 ===========================================================================
   -> Starts by calling main() method of you main class.
   -> The run() method of SpringApplication is called. This method starts the spring application by 
      creating an application context and initializing it.
   -> Once the application context is initialized, the run() method starts the applications 
      embedded web server.
      
 7> Top SpringBoot annotation
 ===========================================================================
  -> @SpringBootApplication : It is the combination of three annotation, @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan.
     it is typically placed on the main class of the application.
  -> @Component : It is used to mark a class as a spring bean that will be managed by the spring container.
  -> @Autowired : This annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies in to a Spring-managed bean.
  -> @Service : This annotation is used to indicate that a class represents a service component in the application. 
                It is typically used to annotate classes that contain business logic.
  -> @Controller : When we have map any URL to our class method at that time we are are using this class as a controller.
  -> @RestController : It is a specialized version of the @Controller annotation that includes the @ResponseBody annotation by default.
  -> @RequestMapping : Used to map specific URL to method . Used on class as well as method level.
  -> @Repository : mark a class as DAO. mostly used on class that has database persistent logic.
  
 8> What is SpringBoot Starters 
 ==========================================================================
  -> Starters are a collection of pre-configured dependencies that make it easier to develop particular kind of application.
  -> These starters includes all dependencies, version control, and configuration needed to make certain features of a SpringBoot application functional.
  
 9> What are the dependencies of SpringBoot ?
 ============================================================================
  -> Spring-boot-starter-parent
  -> Spring-boot-starter-plugin
  -> Spring-boot-starter-test
  -> Spring-boot-starter-security
  -> Spring-boot-starter-actuator
  -> Spring-boot-starter-web
  
 10> What is SpringBoot CLI and what are its benefits ?
 ===========================================================================
  -> Command line tool to create, run and manage Spring Boot applications.
  
 11> What is thymeleaf ?
 =============================================================================
  -> It is a java based server side templating engine used in java web application to render dynamic web page.
