                                                          SpringBoot Annotation
                                             ==================================================

1. @SpringBootApplication Annotation
=====================================================
   This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.
   It encapsulates @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.


2. @Controller
===========================        
       @Controller is used to annotate your class as a controller.

3. @RestController
=========================== 
      @RestController annotation is a combination of @Controller and @Responsebody . it is use to create a RESTful web service .
      if we applied this annotation in our class then no need to annotate class method to @Responsebody . 
      
4. @RequestMapping
===========================
     @RequestMapping annotation which is used to map the HTTP request to our controllers method .
     
5. @GetMapping 
===========================
     @GetMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP Get request in to specific controllers method .
     It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.GET)
     
6. @PostMapping
=============================
    @PostMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP post request to specific controllers method .
    It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.POST).
    
7. @PutMapping
=============================
    @PutMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP PUT request to a specific handler method .
    It is a composed annotation is act as a shortcut for @RequestMapping (method = RequestMethod.PUT).
    
8. @DeleteMapping 
============================
   @DeleteMapping annotation is used to map the HHTP delete request to a specific handlers method .
   It is composed annotation to act as a shortcut for @RequestMappting (Method = RequestMethod.DELETE).
   
9. @Autowired
=============================
   @Autowired annotation in spring framework that enables dependency injection for java classes . It allows spring to automatically inject dependency in the class.
   eliminating the need for manual configuration .
   
10. @Component
==============================
   @Component annotation that allow spring to detect our custom beans automatically . In other word spring will scan our application class and detect which class
    is annotated with @Component . Initiate them  and inject any dependency in to them . 
    
11. @Service
===============================
    @Service annotation indicate that they are holding the business logic .
    
12. @Repository
================================
    @Repository annotation is used to indicate that a class is a repository . This class is used for accessing and manipulating data from database.
    
13. @Componentscan
================================
   @Componentscan is used spring framework for auto detecting and register spring managed components (eg : controller,service,repository etc..) to a specific package.
   
14. @Configuraion
================================
   @Configuraion is used, when we want to create custom bean as per our logic , for that we have to use a class annotated this
   class @Configuraion and create a method, inside this method we return class object and annotated this method @Bean.
   
15. @Value 
=================================
   @Value annotation is used to inject value from external configuration properties / application.properties file in to spring bean .
   
16. @Qualifier
=================================
    @Qualifier annotation is used to specify which beans we have to use , when multiple beans of the same type exist .
    
    Ex: public interface order(){
            public void oderMethod()
           }
           
        @Component
        @Qualifier ("onlineOrder")   
        public class OnlineOder implements order {
             public void oderMethod(){
             
             }
        }
        
        @Component
        @Qualifier ("offlineOrder")  
        public class OfflineOrder implements order {
             public void oderMethod(){
             
             }
        }
        
        public class User {
        
        @Autowired
        @Qualifier("offlineOrder")
        Order order;
          
          order.oderMethod(); // it call the OfflineOrder class method
        }
    
17. @Profile
==================================
   @Profile annotation is used in spring framework to indicate that a component , configuration file , class or methods should be active or inactive 
   based on the specified profile.
   
18. @EnableAutoConfiguraion
===================================
   @EnableAutoConfiguraion annotation is used in spring boot to enable auto configure the application context .
   
19. @Entity
====================================
   @Entity indicates that they are JPA entities . Use @Table to specify table name , if our class name is different from our table name.
   
20. @Primary
=========================================
  @Primary is use when our interface implements in two classes, and when we autowired this interface and call the method 
  it confuse for which class method to call , at that time we have to use @Primary for one class so that always it call 
  the method from this class.
  
  EX:  public interface order(){
            public void oderMethod()
           }
           
        @Component
        @Primary  
        public class OnlineOrder implements order {
             public void oderMethod(){
             
             }
        }
        
        @Component
        public class OfflineOrder implements order {
             public void oderMethod(){
             
             }
        }
        
        public class User {
        
        @Autowired
        Order order;
          
          order.oderMethod(); // it call the OnlineOrder class method
        }
   
  
 21> @ConditionalOnProperty
 ====================================================================================
 -> Bean is created conditionally (Means Bean can be created or not).
 -> In this annotation we have to pass some parameter 
       @ConditionalOnProperty(prefix="",value="",havingValue="",matchifMissing=false)
       
       
 22> @PropertySource & @PropertySources
 ====================================================================================
 -> Spring @PropertySource annotation is used to provide properties file to spring environment.
 -> Spring @PropertySources annotation is used to provide multiple properties files to spring environment.
 -> These annotation is used with @Configuration classes.
 -> Spring @PropertySource annotation is repeatable, means you can have multiple property source on a configuration class.
 -> We can use @value annotation and Environment class 	to read the property file.
 
 23> @PathVariable
 =====================================================================
  -> @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URI (path) of the request.
  -> It extract the data and bind in method parameter.
  -> @PathVariable, when we extract the data at that time we have to maintain the sequence of the data.
  
     @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable("id") Long userId) {}
    
 24> @RequestParam
 ==========================================================================
  -> @RequestParam is used to extract the value from URL and assign in method parameter.
  -> It is use when the data is come in like query. 
  -> Example URI: /users?name=John
   
     @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<User>> getUsersByName(@RequestParam("name") String userName) {}
