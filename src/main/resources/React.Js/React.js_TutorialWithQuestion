 1> What is React
 ===============================================
  -> React is javascript Library.
  -> The main focus is building UI as fast as possible.
  -> So this is used to single page application, means complete website in single page.
  
 2> Why React is fast
 =========================================
   -> React use virtual Dom.
       a. React Dom -> It is update complete List.
       b. Virtual Dom -> update only Required list. 
       
 3> Why learn React
 ==================================================
  -> It is maintained by facebook, so it will long term player in the market.
  -> High demand due to fast speed.
  -> Large community for your support.
  -> we can use mobile app development with React-Native.
  
 4> History & Version
 ==================================================
  -> Maintained by facebook.
  -> First release on 29 may 2013.
  -> The current version is 18.0.0
  -> Apps with React is : NetFlix, Whatsapp web, Instagram.
  
 5> What is npm 
 =====================================================
  -> npm stands in node package manager. 
  -> We can use alternate of npm is yarn.
  
  
 -> In package.json file we can get the current version of react. also this file contains all commands and 
    all package which we are imported, all this present in package.json file.
    
 -> In package-lock.json file, it control the package.json file means it contains all the history of our package also
    it control the version of this package. 
 -> In package-lock.json file, it control of our node module.
 
 6> Which one is most important file in React project
 ===================================================================
  -> Most important file is package.json file.
 
 7> Why we are not push the node_module file in git
 ==================================================================
  -> Because node_module size is big it contains all the file, if we are push in git it take lots of time for that.
     if anathor developer want this file then he can use command 'npm install' , this command take the dependency 
     from package.json file and install it automatically.
     
 8> How to add new npm package
 ===================================================================
   -> Which package we have to install for that we have to copy the package and run the command npm 'Your package name' 
      it install all the libraries in node_module according this.
   -> If we want to change some package version or remove any package just we have to modify it in package.json file and 
      run the command npm install , it automatically change the corresponding libraries version and if any libraries 
      are not required then it delete those libraries.
      
 9> functional Component
 ===================================================================
  -> A piece of code that can be reuse such as function, but more powerful than function .
  -> Component type : 
                     - Functional Component
                     - Class Component
                     - HOC (High order Component)
                     - Pure Component
                     - Controlled Component
                     - Uncontrolled Component
  -> We can create a component inside anathor component. 
  
 10> JSX with React
 =====================================================================
  -> JavaScript xml .
  -> JSX give the power we can write HTML code inside js .
 
 11> State in Functional Component
 =======================================================================
  -> State is basically a object which is contain some data.	
  -> if we are using var/let for store the value, when we are update var/let at that time the variable is not update 
     in every places.
  -> But if we are use state at that time when we are update some value in variable it reflected in every places ,
     means it rerender the component, when we are use state, if any changes come in state it automatically rerender the 
     component for that update value showing in every place.
     
 IQ -> state is public or private ?
       - state is public .
       
 IQ -> can we use useSatate in class component ?
      
      - No, because useState is a hooks and it is not applicable for class component.
 
 
  12> Props with Functional Component
  ======================================================================
  -> Props is like argument, when we are create a component and pass some argument at that time with the help of props 
     we can pass the argument.
     
 IQ -> Can we change the value of Props in receiver component ?
        - No, We can't change the props value in receiver component , it only change in sender component.
        
 13> Life Cycle method in React
 ===============================================================================
  -> Mounting --> ComponentDidMount
  -> Updating --> ComponentDidUpdate
  -> UnMounting --> ComponentWillUnmount
  
  -> When life cycle method is Run
     - When Component is load
     - When Component is update with state and props
     - When Component is removed.
     
 IQ -> if i remove a component then load it once again, then what happen can it's life cycle start from new or it use old life cycle
      A -> it's life cycle start from new .
 
  -> We can't use life cycle method directly in functional component for that we have to use HOOKs.
  -> Why we are using constructor in class component ?
     A-> BCZ, when we load the class component first it ready the  constructor , when we want to do something before ready our
         HTML code , for that we have to use constructor in class component.
         
  14> ComponentDidMount() & ComponentDidUpdate()
  ==============================================================
   -> It call when your HTML and Css code is ready after that it call.
   -> Basically it is use when we are calling API at that time we are use.
   
   IQ -> which one first call render() or ComponentDidMount()
      A-> first call render() after that it call ComponentDidMount().
      
   -> When our HTML code is ready after that ComponentDidMount() is execute. ComponentDidUpdate() is run when 
      any state or props is update.
   -> ComponentDidMount() is not effect for state and props.
   -> if any update perform in state or props after that ComponentDidUpdate() is call.
   
   IQ -> Can we perform setState inside render() ?
      A-> No, bcz any update of state and props render() call again, if we use setState inside render()
          it going to infinite loop.
          
          
  15> shouldComponentUpdate()
  =======================================================================================
    -> it call on the conditional basis.
    -> it stop the specific rendering in a specific condition.
    ->
