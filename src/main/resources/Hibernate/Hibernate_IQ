1. Difference between save and persist method
============================================================
 ->  The return type of Session.save() method is java.io.seriaziable , it return some value as seriaziable object.
   while the return type of Session.persist() method is void.
   
 -> Session.save() method is used inside or outside the transction boundries, but Session.persist() method is
    used only inside the transction boundries.
    
    
2. Difference between save and saveOrUpdate method
================================================================
 -> save() method is used for  insert the record, but saveOrUpdate method is perform for both insert and update , this 
    method is first check the data is present or not then it perform update operation.
    
 -> save() method return some value as as seriaziable object but saveOrUpdate method does not return anything.
 
3. Difference between get and load method
=================================================================
 -> Session.load() always return a proxy (fake) object with out hitting the database. if no row found it thows an ObjectNotFoundException.
    but Session.get() always hit the database and give the real object, if no data found it return null.
 -> load() is better because it support lazy loading.
 -> since load() method throws exception when data is not found ,we should use it only when know data is present or not.
 -> we use get() method when we sure the data is present in data base.
 
 
4. First level cache
================================================================
 -> First level cache which help the users to get fast running the web application. when we hit the query it first check the cache if the data 
    is present for this query then it give the result either it hit the data base, it working for only one SessionFactory object.
 -> First level cache is enabled by default and you can not disable it.
 -> First level cache is associated with only one session object and other session object can't see it.	
 -> The session cache can be clear using clear() method.
 
5. Second Level cache
=================================================================
 -> second level cache is same like first level cache but difference is the first level cache is associated with only one session object but 
    second level cache is associate with every session object .
 -> it does not enable by default, we have to enable it.
 
 6. Difference between JPA and Hibernate
 ================================================================
     JPA
  -----------
  -> ORM = Object Relational Mapping tool is help to map the java object to database table
  -> The java Persistence API provide some guideline for reading and managing data from your java object to data base table.
  -> JPA implements ORM 
  -> Traditionally there have been multiple ORM like : Hibernate ,TopLink , OpenJpa
  
    Hibenate
 ---------------
  -> Hibernate is an object relational mapping tool, that implements JPA.
  -> In short JPA is the interface while Hibernate is implement JPA
